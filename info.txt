Types of stock trading bots:
1. Technical Indicator Bots:
   - These bots look at charts and graphs of a stock's price over time.
   - Instead of studying company reports or financial ratios, they focus on patterns and trends in the stock's price.
   - Traders use indicators like moving averages to predict where the stock price might go next.
   - It helps them decide when to buy or sell stocks based on these price patterns.

2. Experienced Trader Bots:
   - Also known as copy-trading bots.
   - These bots follow successful human traders and copy the trades they make in the stock market.
   - It's like having a mentor â€“ beginners can follow the strategies of more experienced traders.
   - This helps new traders gain confidence in their own trading decisions.

3. Algorithmic Trading Bots:
   - These bots use computer programs to make quick and efficient trades in the stock market.
   - They follow a set of rules written in code to make decisions.
   - This removes emotions from trading, as the bots stick strictly to their programmed strategies.
   - It's a systematic and logical way of trading, helping to avoid mistakes that humans might make.

   - Integrate with brokerage APIs or simulated trading platforms to execute trades.

4. Risk Management:
   - Implement basic risk management features to control the size of trades and set stop-loss levels.
   - Consider adding features to prevent excessive trading or exposure.

5. Backtesting:
   - Develop a backtesting module to evaluate the performance of your algorithm using historical data.
   - This allows you to assess how well your strategy would have performed in the past.

6. User Interface (Optional):
   - For a basic MVP, a simple command-line interface or a basic web-based dashboard can be sufficient.
